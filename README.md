# Project2
## Employee Manager Web Page

***
### An Explanation and Overview of the project:

It allows for full CRUD functionality using the Spring framework in Java, a postgres database for storing employee data, and utilizes Angular to create the web application that handle the front-end. 
I made this with the help of Amigo Codes tutorials and bootdey html snippets for some of the visual aspects of the application. 
This project was meant to help me better understand the full-stack development workflow.

Here are some examples of what the webpage is able to do:
* Display all employees stored in a local database.
* Add new employees to the database through a submitted form.
* Edit an employee through a submitted form.
* Delete an employee using a button.
* Search for an employee using a serch input key.
